## Independent Work

First up let's begin with a challenge. Work on your own to build a simple [Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) calculator.

#### The Rules

* Don't write tests
* Don't do anything fancy with STDIN/STDOUT
* Don't use any extra gems

#### The Expectations

Your program should act as a "REPL" -- Read, Eval, Print, Loop. Here's an example interaction:

#### Enter your calculation:

```
> + 5 4
9
> - 12 6
6
> * 4 2
8
> / 10 5
2
```

Write your program to accept any such numeric inputs any of the operations +, -, *, or /.
